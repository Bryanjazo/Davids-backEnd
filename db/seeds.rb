Api::V1::LearnCrypto.create(header: "What is Decentraland?", blog_text:"Decentraland is a popular blockchain-based virtual world where users can buy and sell plots of land that they can actually develop and build on.  If you have ever played a 3D game, you’ll find that it has a very similar look to it. And besides being gamified it also incorporates a DAO,  which gives its members the ability to help make decisions.  

Decentraland has a token called MANA which is an ERC-20 token. This token can be used to purchase digital real estate parcels, items, and other customizable assets (such as your username).  Land parcels are actually unique ERC-721 NFTs. 

How does Decentraland Work?

Decentraland is a virtual online space that combines blockchain with virtual reality.  Players are involved in a decision-making activity that allows one to control the rules of the online world via the DAO.  Players are also able to vote on organizational and in-game policies. Essentially, everything is controlled by the DAO.  

NFTs play a large part in Decentraland, representing everything from your username, to land to in-game items such as clothing.  Users keep these items in their crypto wallets and can list them for sale on multiple marketplaces.  To buy any new items within the game, you need to have $MANA tokens to purchase. Moreover, secondary sales on other marketplaces will typically sell the items in $ETH.  

Once you have a piece of land, you can build many exciting things on it.  Some players build games, museums to show their art, activities, etc.  Others utilize it for advertising. And if you happen to have a plot in a popular area, you can use it to advertise projects for others. 

Decentraland Use Cases
Applications: Users are allowed to create apps and 3D scenes with Decentraland’s scripting language, which can both increase the quality of projects along with helping to save some money in development. 

Content Curation: Neighborhoods and communities have been developed within Decentraland, where people with common interests and goals meet and work together.

Advertising: Owning spaces in popular areas can lead to revenue for landholders if they are willing to let people rent the space to advertise with. Artists sometimes will even rent a space to hold a temporary gallery showing.

Digital Collectibles: All items in the game are NFTs, which allows you to create and collect them within the game.  Some wearables are even airdropped related to promotions, like the BAYC Sweatshirt (link: 

Social: This digital space can be used for activities or meetings, even entire conventions. It’s a great way to connect with people.   

In conclusion, there are a lot of ways to use Decentraland depending on what you are looking for, anything from a connection to a group of people to advertising for your project, to investing in virtual real estate. But the best way to start is to simply go walk around and check it out! " , catergoryByDate:"Learn Crypto", date:"August 30, 2021")

Api::V1::LearnCrypto.create(header: "Crypto Wallets 101: Custodial vs. Non-Custodial", blog_text:"“Not your keys, not your coins.”
If you invest in cryptocurrency it is important to know who has custody of your tokens. And guess what, it might not be you. We have all heard the phrase “not your keys, not your coins”, but what does that really mean? 

A Basic Overview 

A Custodial Wallet or “hot wallet” is a digital centralized service like an account on an exchange. It is owned by a third party that owes you assets (tokens or currencies). A Non-Custodial or “cold wallet” is decentralized. In this case, only you have access to it. 

When opening up a new non-custodial wallet, you’ll generate a unique, alphanumeric Seed Phrase & Private Key which allows you to access your wallet. Because no one else has these, you shouldn’t share them with anyone in order to keep them safe.  

A seed phrase is a string of 12-24 random words to your wallet that can be used as a backup in case you lose or forget your password. Using it allows you to restore all of your tokens and information.

There are pros & cons to both custodial and non-custodial wallets

There are pros & cons to both custodial and non-custodial wallets.  So it’s important to understand which one is right for what purpose.
Custodial Wallets: Pros
1. Spending
This is the key reason why hot wallets exist. Tokens in custodial wallets are immediately available for use and/or trade.

2. Cheaper
Custodial wallets are digital wallets offered by centralized third parties, like exchanges, which means they typically run on services and will require no gas or other costs.

3. No Keys to Lose
Keeping your keys safe is a major concern. With many of these wallets you can even get your passwords to reset or confirm your identity to regain access to your account should you lose them. 

4. Customer Service
Being that it’s a service being provided to you, custodial wallets typically come with added customer support to help with whatever trouble you may run into.

Custodial Wallets: Cons
1. You Own Debt Not Tokens Directly
Similar to a bank holding your money, or a casino changing your cash for chips, a custodial wallet owes you tokens. In other words, it holds those tokens and can use them for its purposes in the meantime such as for trading liquidity. 

2. KYC and AML Needed
Compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation is required in many cases depending on applicable jurisdictions and legislations. For you, this means you have to submit an ID to use it and that your transaction history is subject to tax oversight.

3. Data Breach/Hack
Hot custodial wallets of exchanges hold a lot of tokens and Personal Private Information (PPI) which makes them prime targets for malicious actors such as hackers or other attackers.

4. Internet Dependency
To view or transfer your tokens, you need internet access. Being cut from accessing the internet implies being cut from your capital.

Non-Custodial Wallets: Pros
1. Unique Keys/Seed Phrase
No one else has access to your credentials. No one can spend your money without your unique keys. Not the wallet provider, not the authorities, not the banks. You must authorize every transaction and fee you spend.

2. Lower Risk of Data Breach/Hack
Everyone is a potential target for hackers, just like everyone is a potential target of theft. But being a single wallet with a relatively small amount of tokens compared to what an exchange would hold, reduces your risk of being targeted by attackers.

3. Instant Withdrawals
Having full control means you can move your tokens whenever you want, without any preset delay period imposed by third parties, which are common practices with exchanges.

4. Non-Internet Reliant
Local cold wallets can be accessed without any internet access. And while you may not be able to transact or purchase crypto, you can at least see how many tokens you hold and that they are safe.

Non-Custodial Wallets: Cons
1. No Customer Service
If you make a mistake, you are stuck with the consequences. One typo can mean a loss, and there’s no way of undoing mistakes.

2. Keys Lost = Money Lost
If you lose your password & seed phrase, no one can help you restore your wallet or information. So be very careful! 

3. Higher Fees
Fees are based on ETH gas costs, which depend on the price of ETH and the congestion of the network. These fees fluctuate wildly and get pretty high at times.

4. More Responsibility
If it is your first crypto purchase, you may not be comfortable sending funds to a cold wallet or setting one up. Although it is not technically difficult, it can at times be emotionally overwhelming.

Which one is better ?
Many people use a combination of both wallet types
You shouldn’t place all your eggs in one basket, just as you shouldn’t store all your tokens in one wallet. Distributing assets between multiple wallets is a much safer approach. The result of this though is more credentials to remember and keep safe.  Find out about best practices to keep your crypto safe.

Fundamentally, it is a trade-off between convenience & security
Custodial wallets are easier to deal with and more convenient if you’re looking to move assets or participate in the markets. But the fear of major problems like attacks should be enough to make one want a second, non-custodial cold wallet to store what you want to keep for the long term.

Api::V1::LearnCrypto.create(header: "How To Quit Your Job And Pursue Crypto Full-Time", blog_text:"By Danielle Davis

If you were looking for an article on day trading, this is not the one for you. On the other hand, if you are hoping to learn how to get your foot in the door in the crypto space, you came to the right place.  

The methods below will not work for everyone. But if you are determined to find a way out of the monotonous 9-5 and into your office in the basement, this article will give you some great starting points. 

For starters, let’s discuss some of the entry-level jobs in this space. To get your foot in the door, you usually need to start at the bottom. That can be frustrating but considering how fast crypto moves, it could be a much shorter journey than it would be in the corporate world.  Here are some examples of entry-level jobs along with ways to get into them. 

Community Manager

Community Managers do a variety of tasks oriented around the community, a big surprise I know.  This person might be responsible for organizing the moderators, posting on social media (if there isn’t a designated social media manager), organizing events that keep the community engaged, and keeping the community up to date about what is going on in the project. The best way to get a community manager position is to become an active member of the community that already exists. Often those chosen for these jobs come from within the existing user base.  So join in and be active.  

Artist

If you have any artistic talent, there is a LOT of work out there for you.  Logos, banners, website art, NFTs, posters, video editing, etc.  People will always need good artists.  Working with a project often gets artists way more traction than simply selling NFTs on their own.  They can then take their reputation with them to make more money from their art.  

You must insist on being named/credited for your work. Otherwise, it is not helping your reputation long term by working with them.  If you find a project that has a similar style to your own, get involved with the community, and simply offer to make stuff for them when opportunities arise.  You will be surprised how often a spur-of-the-moment idea needs some art.  For example, while I am not the best artist, I have been sent a few spur-of-the-moment logos and NFT requests for people simply because I was willing and there.    

Moderator

Here’s another opportunity: Did you know that you can moderate a Discord or Telegram community for a project, answering questions and serving as a resource for participants on the forum. While some projects may not pay their moderators, don’t hesitate to be upfront in stating that you are expecting payment. I mean who wouldn’t want to be paid for their work.  

Often people will moderate several chats at once, which means there is no cap to the amount of money they can make. Again, like the community manager you want to be engaged in the chats to be considered for a moderator position. Often in noticing chats that need moderating, you can simply step in and start doing the job.  

Influencer 

Influencers are people who bring status to a community. They are important because of the strict rules on Twitter and Facebook against advertising crypto projects.  Influencers typically have a larger following or a very engaged audience allowing them to be successful in what they do.  

While acquiring followers can be easily done with large giveaways, an engaged community takes time to build.  Find something you can offer the community, start providing information they didn’t have before, or even just find a way to be entertaining.  Build up your account and reputation and then people will start coming into your DMs offering you $$ to tweet for them.

Be sure to do your research on these projects before saying yes to them).    

There are scores of other positions throughout the space led by people with no formal education. Take me for example, I have no formal marketing training or experience but have landed several full-time jobs in CMO or Marketing Manager positions in my short 10 months in the crypto space.  

In conclusion, my advice for breaking into this space is to work your BUTT OFF. There’s no way around it. So be professional as you’ll find it appreciated in a space where it’s not the norm. Also, pick projects you love as it will be much easier to be excited about doing it when you already love the project." , catergoryByDate:"Learn Crypto", date:"August 5, 2021")

Api::V1::LearnCrypto.create(header: "Lose Your Wallet Password? Here’s Where To Start The Recovery Journey", blog_text:"As crypto enthusiasts, many of us have a love-hate relationship with passwords.  While we need them to access our online accounts and protect our privacy and financial data, they’re often challenging to keep track of (safely). Moreover, they are at risk of attack, exposing our identification, and worse, opening up our financial assets to nefarious actors. 

As the crypto industry continues to grow in value, users must implement strong measures to keep their cryptocurrency safe from cryptojacking.

Managing Your Crypto Coins

To own cryptocurrency, first, select a reputable crypto exchange or wallet (visit CoinMarketCap to start your research). You can then establish a password or keyphrase, purchase crypto, and determine how you want to manage your holdings. 

When keeping your wallet on the exchange keep in mind that you aren’t in full control of your coins. They can also be exposed to security breaches or hacking. 

A better option might be to act as your own bank, by establishing your own cryptocurrency wallet using a wallet app installed on your mobile device or desktop. While these non-custodial wallets allow you access to a range of crypto activity, they also require you to be responsible for and safeguard your password.

Once you’ve established your non-custodial account, keep your password, or private key, and recovery phrase in a safe place, because if you lose it, you can lose access to your cryptocurrency.

You can also keep track of your coins using hardware wallets and paper wallets. Here, the selection of the wallet type and provider depends on the level of security and range of crypto activity options that you desire. 

What Happens If You Lose Your Password?

The basic steps in recovering your password, if not recorded, misplaced, forgotten, or physically destroyed, is to try logging in with every possible password or combination of versions you might have used.  If you were required to set up a 12 or 24-word recovery phrase, this process offers a slightly different set of parameters to navigate. 

If you come up short on these attempts, it’s time to utilize a password hacker.  There are password cracking tools, such as John the Ripper or Hashcat. Get familiar with how these tools work before installing any software.

Another option is to use a password recovery service, such as Wallet Recovery Services (WRS).  Dave Bitcoin (pseudonym), owner of WRS has been cracking codes since 2013, gaining a reputation as the trusted person to go to for wallet recovery.  

The launch of WRS wasn’t easy in the beginning.  In reviewing original discussions on the Bitcoin forum, bitcointalk.org, it’s clear what Dave Bitcoin was up against.  As expected, building trust in the community was the biggest challenge. Today, with countless testimonials to date, Dave has grown a sustainable business, bringing financial happiness and relief to those who had misplaced their credentials.  

Dave understands and appreciates that different clients build trust in their own ways, and for Dave, he’ll take the time that’s needed to establish these connections. 

As the Blockchain industry continues to explode and evolve at warp speed, so does the need to stay up with the latest wallet technology.  Dave says, “supporting the widest range of wallets and associated problems is something I specialize in.”

Dave says he regularly gets queries on lost passwords, corrupt wallet files, hundreds of different wallet types and cryptocurrencies, incorrect recovery phrases, misconfigured derivation paths, and crypto sent to incorrect addresses and even incorrect blockchains.

So What’s Needed to Attempt A Recovery?

To attempt solving a password or 12 or 24-word recovery phrase, a few pieces of information are needed. This includes the type of coin and wallet, what particular problem the client is having, and the user’s best guess on possible passwords or fragments that frequently make up the usual passwords. Dave says that it’s also important to establish that the client is in fact the owner of the wallet and that the wallet is not stolen or acquired (usually from the internet).  

He remarks, “I also try to establish how likely it is that the wallet might be unlocked. I think it’s fair to provide the client with a realistic evaluation of how things might go.”

For details on how to contact Dave, visit his Contact Us page.

How Difficult Is It to Crack the Code?

Dave’s ability to recover a password depends on a few considerations, such as the type of wallet and how accurate the client’s recall is.  Dave says, “we are able to identify some in 10 seconds or less, while others take months of computer time.”  But Dave is constantly improving his system.  In fact, Dave’s been able to crack a notably different case 3 or 4 years later.

Recovery phrases present interesting challenges.  Because they follow a fixed pattern, for example, a sequence of 12 or 24 words drawn from a list of 2,048, working with phrases can be easier than finding a freeform password where there is no obvious pattern.  If a customer misrecords a single word, testing all 2,048 replacements will find the solution.  The challenge comes when multiple words are misrecorded, unreadable, or jumbled.  

In this case, Dave Bitcoin says:  “three unreadable words in known locations would require 8.5 billion tests to check all possibilities … becoming rapidly impractical even if you parallelize the tests across multiple fast computers.”

Biggest Mistakes When Setting Up & Storing Passwords

Damned if we do, damned if we don’t.  Creating a highly unusual or difficult password can make cracking the password much harder. But the opposite is just as true in terms of security and safety.  

So what gives? 

Well, the moral to the story is this: whether you use a randomly generated password or create a highly complex one of your own… 

Write. It. Down.  

And, Dave suggests storing it in two different spots, in places where it will go undisturbed, but not forgotten.  Otherwise, you run the risk of throwing it away, losing it during a move, or unfortunately destroying it by water or fire.

Dave also advises to never take a snapshot of your phrase or password and leave it on your phone, as you may forget it the next time you reset your phone or buy a new one.  The same goes for keeping it on your hard drive.  This might work for a few years, that is until your computer gets old and you need to replace it.  Dave says he’s seen all these mishaps happen to clients!

Another option to consider is a password manager.  This third-party service generates cryptographically secure passwords that you can keep in a secure location and access them as needed.

A few providers to review are Keeper, Dashlane, RoboForm, which have been written up in the Best Password Managers of 2021. Of course, evaluate and do your research.

Api::V1::LearnCrypto.create(header: "What Is A Wrapped Token? Why Do We Need It?", blog_text:"By Danielle Davis

If you’re in the world of crypto, you are probably aware of one of the biggest current issues of the industry. 

It’s called Interoperability.

There is now an unprecedented amount of capital being invested in the crypto space along with increased adoption rates (especially since Bitcoin crushed all-time-highs again), and greater numbers of blockchains available, both big & small.

Interoperability means connecting isolated blockchains
Cryptocurrency consists of multiple chains each with its own native assets: Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, etc. This means that a token cannot be taken from one chain and simply sent to another because it doesn’t exist on that blockchain. There is, however, one way to work around this limitation. This is known as “Wrapped Tokens.” 

Wrapped Tokens Do Not Contain the Original Token

A wrapped token is essentially one token on the “destination” blockchain pegged to the value of the “origin” token. For example,  wrapped Bitcoin is pegged to the price of Bitcoin but exists on the Ethereum blockchain. It is not Bitcoin, but it represents Bitcoin in that it is locked in a vault back on its original chain. 

How Do I Get Wrapped Tokens? 

You can simply buy already wrapped tokens on the chain you wish to have them on.  There is enough liquidity of the wrapped tokens where you can simply buy WBTC on ETH via Uniswap. However, you can also wrap your Bitcoin from its native chain and receive WBTC on the ETH network. 

What Happens To Your Tokens When You Wrap Them? 

Despite the name, the tokens are not actually “wrapped”.  This allows them to move across other blockchains. Tokens are, however, staked in a locked vault. When you do this, an equal value of a new token on the “destination” blockchain is generated for you. This new token then becomes a direct representation of the value of the original asset.

Also keep in mind that you can unstake tokens to unwrap them, or remove them from this “vault”, to get the original back. 

Benefits of Wrapped Tokens

Every blockchain is different and enforces its own standards, meaning that many tokens cannot be used across other chains.  Wrapped tokens allow for non-native tokens to be used on other blockchains.

You can compare wrapping to a loaner car you use while yours is in the shop: a quick fix to an outstanding issue. 

Wrapped tokens increase liquidity and capital efficiency for exchanges as they offer their users greater trading options.

Lastly, the transaction fees and times can vary on each chain which can be to your benefit.  If you are moving an asset like Bitcoin, we all know that the transaction times can be very long. Moving WBTC is much quicker. 

Limitations Of Wrapped Tokens

Wrapped tokens are a form of staking which requires a custodian to hold the tokens in the vault. So it’s not decentralized. Fees for wrapping tokens are also quite high, but buying them already wrapped will help alleviate that cost. 

While a wrapped token is not the same thing as the original token on its native chain, using them can simplify our lives by letting us work across chains without any barriers. Interoperability, though, is still a huge challenge in the crypto space, and hopefully, soon we will see more solutions to the problem.", catergoryByDate:"Learn Crypto", date:"August 2, 2021")

Api::V1::WritersFeed.create(header: "Why The U.S. Lags Behind Other Countries In Adopting Cryptocurrencies.", blog_text:"There is no denying that interest in cryptocurrencies is continuing to grow in America. Despite the fact that the U.S. lags behind many other countries that have a significantly larger percentage of their population invested in digital coins.

Why is that? 

Americans Are All About Crypto

Americans are all about crypto, at least when it comes to search engines. Last year there were approximately 2.5 million online searches regarding bitcoin. With billionaires like Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, and many A-list celebrities and professional sports figures touting it as the future of finance, interest in learning about and investing in cryptocurrencies has surged over the last two years. Even a roller coaster ride of market volatility has not deterred Americans from continuing to explore and invest in digital currencies. 

 A report from Portfolio Insider estimates approximately 46 million Americans have purchased a digital currency of some kind, approximately 17 percent of the adult population. Surprisingly, that only lands us at number 26 on a list of 27 countries with the highest percentage of the population invested in some kind of digital currency according to this report by Finder.com. 

Countries With The Largest Number of Crypto Owners

So what countries are at the top of that list? 

It may surprise you (or not) to know that the top five countries with the most people invested in digital currencies are all in Asia. Vietnam landed at number one on the list with 41 percent of the adult population reporting some kind of digital coin investment. Indonesia, India, Malaysia, and the Philippines are next. The top European country with the most citizens reporting investment in digital currency is Belgium at number six followed by Italy at number 10. 

Tiny countries like Austria, New Zealand, and Ireland all rank higher than the United States in terms of the biggest percentage of the population invested in cryptocurrencies. 

Analysts believe that countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, and now Afghanistan have seen surges in crypto purchases because there is mistrust in their government’s management of financial markets or they don’t have access to a centralized exchange. Also, many residents of these countries “turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, as well as to send and receive remittances and carry out business transactions.” CNBC.com

Will the U.S. Catch Up?

Despite lagging behind many other countries in adopting cryptocurrencies, the United States still leads the way in decentralized finance (DeFi) adoption, keeping the doors wide open for investments in cryptocurrencies to surge in the next few months and in 2022. 

The two main causes of lesser crypto investments in this country are education, delays by lawmakers to approve several cryptocurrencies, and attempts to heavily regulate the industry.  

It is clear Americans are eager to invest in the crypto space but a lack of education about how digital currencies work is holding many of them back.  A survey by MasterCard of 15,000 people from 18 different countries (including the U.S., of course) revealed that millennials (people ages 23 to 40[ish]) are the most active crypto researchers and investors. That tracks with the average age of U.S. citizens most likely to research and buy digital coins. In the survey, most people said a lack of understanding of how cryptocurrencies work is what gives them pause about buying any. 

New tax reporting legislation written into the recently passed massive infrastructure bill is widely viewed as stifling the crypto market and SEC Chairman Hester Peirce has cautioned lawmakers about attempting to overregulate the industry.

“The disproportionate focus on illicit uses and the underestimation of the protective uses of crypto is one example of how evidence-based rulemaking is not yet the norm in crypto-regulation. We can do better, and I hope that this year will mark a turning point for the United States, which in turn may spur other countries similarly to take a more sensible approach to crypto regulation.” Hester Peirce

Lack of education and legislative attempts to increase regulation of the crypto industry have been holding back the United States from leading the world in cryptocurrency ownership, but that is not predicted to last.  With Bitcoin recently reaching an all-time high, investors and institutions pouring billions into the asset class, and more and more companies accepting digital coins as payment for their goods and services, 2022 is predicted to be a turning point for mainstream adoption.  

America Can Lead In Cryptocurrency Adoption

Investors and analysts agree, cryptocurrencies are not a fad and are here to stay. The United States is poised to lead the world in digital coin adoption despite lagging behind other countries with more citizens already invested. America has the most crypto ATMs, and the non-profit Digital Dollar Project has launched five pilot programs to test the potential uses of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). 

A CBDC is basically a digital banknote and gives holders a direct digital claim on the central bank,  allowing them to make instant electronic payments. China and much of Europe have already invested in CBDCs and are racing to “fend off threats from cryptocurrencies and improve payment systems,” according to a report from Reuters.com

Widespread access to digital dollars will help streamline payment processes and increase financial inclusion for millions of Americans hindered by traditional financial institutions’ transaction fees. 

With our technological savvy, innovation, and the eagerness of tens of millions of Americans to learn about and invest in cryptocurrencies it is foreseeable the U.S. will lead the world in digital currency adoption. It is a matter of more widespread education programs about how cryptocurrencies work and pressure on legislators to back off crippling regulations in the industry.

Api::V1::WritersFeed.create(header: "After The Poly Network Hack: The Story of a 500K Bounty Program", blog_text:"Recently, the Poly Network had to face the biggest network hack in DeFi history. A hacker known as MrWhiteHat stole people’s funds across blockchains.

After being the victim of a $610 million hack, Poly Network took matters into its own hands by announcing a bug bounty program with Immunefi. 

What Happened to Poly Network?
Poly Network is a platform that allows interoperability between multiple blockchains. In this way, different blockchains can work together and change the way cryptocurrencies work. 

In other words, this platform helped users transfer or exchange tokens across different blockchains. 

And then, the hack happened. 

One ordinary day, a hacker attacked the Poly network managing to steal 611M – arguably the biggest hack on DeFi so far. Poly Network immediately issued a statement to its community, addressed the hacker, and advocated for a peaceful resolution. 

The hacker returned $10,000, which was later followed by $1M. Beyond some $33M that had been frozen by Tether, MrWhiteHat returned the rest of the funds by the end of the following day.

Yet, what is still unclear is why the hacker carried out the theft. 

It still is unknown whether it was to alert the platform of the flaw in its security system or whether it was to launder money? Well, according to the hacker, he just wanted to have fun… although this caused a tsunami of collective terror.

Certainly, this situation proved to be a wake-up call for most platforms in terms of reviewing their security systems. It also tested how quickly each of these platforms would react to such an attack.

The Aftermath Of The Hack: Damage Control
Many people are still wondering what made this heist possible. Well, it is generally agreed in the tech security world that the hacker found a small bug that could bring down the entire security system of the platform. 

This bug was responsible for the system vulnerability that made this heist possible. It’s a theft that became part of DeFi’s history and will always be remembered. 

Yet, the Poly Network is attempting to leverage the situation by announcing its “Roadmap for Recovery“. The plan lays out how the network will be able to restore operations and fully recover user assets. The network also offered an apology to the community along with a roadmap for what’s ahead.

The Poly Bounty Hack
But these are not the only announcements made by the platform. They also are promoting a highly publicized $500,000 bug bounty program. 

This works out perfectly as anyone who cares about DeFi security can take part. 

Security is now more important than ever for the Poly Network as well as the safe return of assets to its users. 

All these announcements show concern for the security of their users. They are working vigorously to maintain people’s trust in the DeFi circle.

Immunefi – a renowned bug bounty platform – is part of the bug bounty. The initiative began on August 17. Prizes include $100,000 for each valid bug, with a total reward pool of $500,000. 

In short, DeFi’s popularity needs more security to continue growing. Poly Network is now at the center of attention with respect to this narrative. As a result, it is re-evaluating its performance before and after the hack, making changes to ensure a secure future. Each of Poly Network’s announcements marks a before and after for the platform. 

Poly Network handled the situation to the best of its ability. Their responses were quick and their action plans show that they want to keep their users safe and that they care about them. Yet, it is hard not to see what happened to them as a kind of cautionary tale. Let’s hope Poly can continue to bounce back and recover.

", blog_text:"There’s nothing quite like that end of summer feeling when the evenings cool down and you can smell fall in the gentle breeze. The end of summer ushers in a bit of sadness because the carefree days of the season are coming to a close. But the promise of fall helps alleviate that melancholy. 

And if they haven’t started already, kids will be heading back to school soon. Remember the fun of buying school supplies as a youngster? This time of the year can be exciting, but it also signals a return to routines. This can be a challenge for young ones and adults alike. 

We can avoid the struggle of adjusting to a back-to-school routine by taking a few steps to prepare and you’ll enjoy this season even more. 

Outfit Planning

Rather than waiting until Monday morning to pick out your ensemble for the day, try planning it out the night before. It’s hard enough to get the kids to wake up on time, let alone carve out a few minutes to eat breakfast and get ready for your own day to begin. Plus, mornings generally feel rushed because you’re on a deadline to get out of the door and get the kids onto the school bus and then over to the office. Take five minutes the night before to set aside what you and your kiddos want to wear for the next day. You’ll seriously thank yourself in the morning!

Meal Prep

While you’re at it, take another 10 minutes in the evening to put together a decent lunch for your day. You may not feel like figuring out what to eat for tomorrow, but doing so will help you avoid the pitfalls of not having a lunch picked out. 

Of course, your kiddos may be able to buy school lunch. But not every adult has an in-office cafeteria, meaning you either forgo lunch–not a great idea–or you have to rush over to a fast-food place to scarf down something vaguely resembling food. Planning lunch ahead of time can help you avoid eating bad food or starving all day long. 

Go to Bed

Watching just one more episode of your favorite series on Netflix late at night can be so tempting. Pretty soon, one episode leads to another and another and sure enough, it’s midnight and you finished the whole season. And it always sounds like a good idea at the time. Until your alarm goes off in the morning and you seriously regret your binge-watching idea. 

Aim for seven or more hours of sleep if you can, then give yourself a bedtime, just like you do for your kids. While it might not feel very fun, your day will go so much better when you all get the right amount of shut-eye. 

Choose Your Alarm Wisely

Hitting the snooze button once your alarm clock starts blaring can be all too tempting. Except you can easily fall into the trap of repeatedly hitting snooze just to doze off for a few moments and be rudely awakened–again–by that darn alarm clock. 

On the flip side, some people try to grab as much sleep as they possibly can and set an alarm that doesn’t even give them time to fully wake up, let alone eat breakfast or drop the kids off at the bus stop. 

Go for a happy medium and set your alarm so you have enough time to get ready without a mad rush, yet not so much time that you feel free to hit snooze nine times in a row. 

Blockchain Goes Academic

In this back-to-school season, more and more useful technologies are cropping up. Blockchain is even getting used by some schools, interestingly enough. In addition to its uses in record-keeping, some educators are giving cryptocurrency to students as a way to incentivize them to do well. 

A Better Back to School Season

Employing some of these tips as you and your family get back into your fall routines can really help smooth things out. And who knows, you just might hear more about blockchain as we enter this back-to-school season. " , catergoryByDate:"Lifestyle", date:"September 6, 2021")

Api::V1::WritersFeed.create(header: "Taking Steps Toward Negating Our Carbon Footprint", blog_text:"By LeeAnn Sherman

Carbon footprints are the greenhouse and carbon dioxide gases emitted by products manufactured, produced, and transported to consumers. This footprint encompasses coffee beans, chocolate, cars, and other commodities that wreak havoc on our environment. It includes a series of impacts involving climate change, air pollution, deforestation, forest fires, plastic wastes, coral reefs, and marine ecosystem contamination (skip that tuna sandwich). 

What Is The Significance of This? 

There is strong evidence to suggest that consumer habits are driving climate change. For example, the manufacturing, production, and transport of our everyday household goods represent 60% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the typical American emits five times more greenhouse gases than the average global citizen. It means that our purchases and consumption of household goods devours 45% of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions because we are buying more stuff.

Merchant Companies Taking the Lead

Merchant companies, such as American Express (“Amex”) and Mastercard have created programs that reinvest added funding to help decrease the carbon footprint and contribute to improving the environment. For example, in 2017, Amex contributed $40 million in charitable funds globally, achieving a 50% decrease in its carbon footprint for emissions compared to 2011 (American Express, 2018). 

Mastercard is working with a Swedish sustainability-focused FinTech company that created a consumer-friendly app to track its carbon footprint. The app, aligned with the Priceless Planet Coalition and its sustainability campaigns, has targeted the restoration of 100 million trees around the planet. This provides consumers with methods to offset their negative carbon footprint.

These environmental forces within the global landscape suggest that some companies practice conscious capitalism in an age where being socially responsible has become critical. According to Mastercard, “A large proportion of adults (85%) state they’re willing to take personal action to combat environmental and sustainability issues in 2021” (Mastercard, 2021).

The Spillover Effect

A positive spillover effect, such as Mastercard’s app, means that the actions of organizations or countries create benefits to other organizations or countries. With large conglomerate companies, such as Amex and Mastercard taking the lead on these sustainable global issues, other corporations and governments are sure to follow suit. These spillover effects also create more jobs, address human rights issues, and foster more substantial global initiatives tasked with environmental protection. 

Global networks, such as the Environmental Impact Index (EII), also develop new global measures for domestic and international environmental impacts to combat these negative global footprints. These measurements are at country levels to help collect the necessary data to target attainable goals to work towards – collectively.

Individual Efforts and Mindfulness

For those of you that would like to contribute to the health of our environment and the reduction of our greenhouse gases, here is a list of items that can make a small impact:

• Educate yourself

• Ride a bike

• Avoid pouring chemicals into drains (waterways)

• Reuse cloth shopping bags

• Conserve water

• Recycle

• Buy gently used items

• Use long-lasting light bulbs

• Avoid burning yard waste

• Dispose of old medications at a local fire station

• Donate old items to a local charity

• Avoid buying products in excess

Our everyday actions can help our environment in many ways. When we practice these mindful methods, it helps to encourage others to do the same or at least lead by example. With this optimism, the hope is that more people, organizations, and countries negate these carbon footprints." , catergoryByDate:"Lifestyle", date:"July 6, 2021")

Api::V1::WritersFeed.create(header: "BEXT360’s Ambitious Journey To Bring Blockchain to Developing Countries", blog_text:"Emerging technologies are creating opportunities for greater equity within developing countries that produce the very commodities we consume and utilize on a daily basis. 

Whether it be coffee, cotton, cocoa, minerals, or palm oil, a digitized supply chain utilizing blockchain and other emerging technologies is improving access, accountability, transparency, traceability, pricing, product quality, and speed of delivery. 

This optimization serves every stakeholder at each step within a supply chain network.  The outcome translates into improved livelihoods of production communities, greater peace of mind for wholesalers and retailers, and a more satisfying experience for end-use consumers.

So, Who’s Reconfiguring Supply Chain Solutions?

A young Denver-based software technology company, Bext Holdings Inc., has developed a complete digitized logistics system, or bext360 that can serve an entire product supply chain ecosystem from origin to end-user.  

 Using the SaaS platform, bext360 allows companies to track the origin, authenticity, and sustainability of their products. 

With the use of Blockchain, AI, and mobile app technologies, their software is embedded into existing ERP and POS systems to provide end-to-end traceability for wholesalers and retailers. Data is collected at every stage of the supply chain, sustainable measures are qualified, and all of this becomes an immutable record on the Blockchain. 

The benefit of Real-Time Transactions

Traditionally, small farmers in developing countries are subject to middlemen who determine the quality and price of the crop and control how and when the farmers get paid.  Instead, bext360 has created an alternative means for adhering to a consistent process of assessing quality, generating a fair price, and paying farmers instantaneously once the crops have changed hands. 

This is how it works: at the place of origin, bext360 utilizes a high-tech device or kiosk with the capabilities of analyzing crops, such as coffee cherries, by putting them through an imaging system that can determine the size and consistency of a cherry yield.  Using AI technology, the device captures a 360-degree image of the crops to assign an industry standard of quality and weight of the product being sold through Bluetooth IoT connection. 

Bext360’s software utilizes Stellar, a global payment solution employing blockchain technology.  Through bext360 mobile app, the buyer and seller can facilitate the transaction by recording product quantity while processing instant payments to farmers based on price and weight.  All this data is inputted into traceable software.  The farmer can then be paid instantaneously in real-time at the point of selling the products.  For the retailer receiving shipments, a QR code is used to trace their products as they move end-to-end through the supply chain.

How Did This Start-Up Start?

From the U.S. and China to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and India, entrepreneur, founder and CEO Daniel Jones spent over 17 years living and working in emerging and frontier markets. 

With deep knowledge in technology, applied mathematics, and e-commerce, Jones envisioned a network of digital solutions to solve the access needs in developing economies and improve the traceability, accountability, and sustainability of goods throughout the supply chain.

SKS Venture Partners, an investment company that focused mostly on financial tech companies, invested $1.2 million of seed funding monies to support the launch and future developments of bext360.  In 2017, bext360 become the first company to trace coffee from origin to retailer using Blockchain.

Blockchain Brings Hope to New Ways of Doing Business Worldwide

According to the Fairtrade Foundation, “coffee is one of the world’s most popular beverages.  Around 125 million people worldwide depend on coffee for their livelihoods and 80% of it is produced by 25 million smallholders.”  However, many of these small-scale farmers are unable to earn equitable and reliable wages from the coffee beans they grow, harvest, and produce.

Emerging technologies like Blockchain remain promising. In terms of breaking through issues of fraud, exploitation, and sustainability by digitizing and streamlining the supply chain process.

Api::V1::WritersFeed.create(header: "Crypto Gets Game-Day Treatment", blog_text:"Cryptocurrency payment options are the rage these days. And the sports world is no exception. 

After Tesla began accepting bitcoin for purchases, PayPal announced it would allow certain users to “Checkout with Crypto” and settle transactions with millions of businesses. (Read more on that PayPal announcement here.)  

That trend has now found its way into Major League Baseball (MLB) as teams make changes to their consumer model due to the global pandemic. The MLB news happened like this: In March 2021, the Oakland A’s announced it would accept payments in Bitcoin for seasonal use of private suites—offering the opportunity for fans to become “the first Bitcoin suite holders in sports.” 

At the time of the announcement, fans could pay about $65,000 in fiat for the full-season suite, or 1 BTC, which hovered just under $60,000 at the end of March. Since state health guidelines limit stadium seating arrangements, private suites open up the opportunity for groups of up to six to sit together. This includes access to a private restroom and Coliseum snacks. 

In short, the Oakland A’s  bet on the idea that fans will use bitcoin for the ultimate fan experience. This move seems to be paying off as evidenced by the decision on the part of Voyager Digital Ltd., “a publicly-traded, licensed crypto-asset platform” to purchase a full-season Oakland A’s suite for one Bitcoin. This milestone is reputed to be  the first purchase of an MLB ticket offering in crypto. 

“More and more digital assets are becoming sought-after forms of payment as businesses and consumers embrace cryptocurrencies,” noted Steve Ehrlich, CEO and co-founder of Voyager, in an April press release. 

The Story Behind An Historic MLB Purchase

So how did this MLB sale happen? 

“We had been hearing from our fans for about 9 months that they were interested in purchasing things in bitcoin or cryptocurrency,” Dave Kaval, team president of the Oakland A’s, himself a bitcoin holder told Gokhshtein Media in an interview, adding that fans had discussed everything from hotdogs to sponsorships. “And we were floored with the interest,” Kaval continued, revealing that the team received various requests, including from Voyager and others who bought partial seasons of 10 or 20 games. 

He called the home opener on April 1st which allowed a percentage of fans to “safely” gather—”historic,” explaining that it was the first time in more than a year that fans were in the stadium. “It’s actually been a much bigger success than we anticipated, and we are excited to continue to offer it this season for partial suites,” he said. 

With this achievement, Kaval notes that the team may also allow payments in cryptocurrency for other products. 

And oh, in case you were wondering, the team isn’t transferring the assets to fiat. “We are keeping it in bitcoin,” Kaval said. “We’re a believer in Bitcoin in terms of it providing an alternative way for people to pay […] and we think it’s an important part of running a business in the 21st century.”

Cryptocurrency’s Emergence In Professional Sports

As stadiums continue to reopen, could other sports teams accept cryptocurrency? And could it become more mainstream in the coming months?

Well, NBA Top Shot—selling licensed National Basketball Association (NBA) moments that are “minted on the blockchain in limited supply”—has brought non-fungible tokens (aka NFTs) to the world of sports. In today’s version of trading cards, it’s brought more than 7.6 million collectible and licensed moments to thousands of fans. And that’s to the tune of more than $300,000,000 transacted in beta, through March 2021, the site reports. 

More NBA news? In March of 2021, billionaire investor and Mavericks owner Mark Cuban announced the Mavericks basketball team would begin accepting payment for tickets and merchandise in dogecoin. Cuban then announced via Twitter that the team did more than 20,000 Dogecoin transactions in just a few days.” (The Mavericks had already been accepting payments in Bitcoin.)

And when the NFL’s Panthers player Russell Okung’s salary was partly converted to bitcoin, it drew headlines in December 2020. At that time, one bitcoin was less than $30,000; now one bitcoin, at press time, is in the $55,000 to $60,000 range. That conversion would have paid off, in his favor, to the tune of millions of dollars. 

So are these reports just blips in the world of sports, or will there be more news to come? If fans are willing to continue to pay in cryptocurrency, then stay tuned. “If Major League Baseball is taking bitcoin, you kind of know it’s going mainstream,” said Kaval. “And so I think it’s an important day for crypto and the innovation this represents.”" , catergoryByDate:"What's Trending", date:"April 19, 2021")

Api::V1::WritersFeed.create(header: "Pouring a New NFT of Wine", blog_text:"NFTs are continuing to grow in popularity in 2021. Celebrities and famous brands are not only issuing them but they are starting to be sold on NFT marketplaces. 

Enter Hello Fam!, the first winery that’s creating NFTs with rarity-traits that are backed by real physical wine cases of wine that have been produced. Wine can be bought, sold, and traded while the wine is sold somewhere else. Or the NFTs can be burned to claim the wine. 

I recently had the chance to interview Adam Ashkan, co-founder of Hello Fam! He shared the story of his first entrepreneurial experience at the age of 16 and how his idea of connecting grapes and NFT was born. 

A little about your background and what led you to the crypto space

I made my first crypto investment in 2013 and since then fell in love! I started writing about crypto as a journalist a few years after and then became a consultant to over 20 blockchain startups. Outside of crypto I also worked for Wine Spectator as their head of mobile and created two games, one video game and one card game (Nimble Strong: Bartender in Training and ICICLES). I met the Vinsent team years ago and fell in love with their mission of helping wineries sell directly to consumers and they invited me to become an advisor.

Why did you decide to become an entrepreneur? 

I started very early, building a large art community that grew to one million members when I was 16 years old. Since then I’ve gone back and forth between working for others and working for myself, depending on my cash situation and the idea!

Tell us about your co-founders

We have an amazing team! We’re co-founded by Vinsent, which distributes wine for 100+ wineries and owns its own vineyard. We worked together for years prior. We’re also co-founded by Tiffany Wong, who is a brilliant and incredibly fast art director who worked with me at Wine Spectator. 

What Is Hello Fam! Winery? How does it work? And why NFT?

What we do is very simple — our grape character NFTs are backed by collectible wine that we’re producing and storing. So you can trade NFTs freely and then burn them if you ever want to redeem the wine. Even better, our NFTs have rarities attached! 

So if you get a rare grape, you’ll get extra benefits, like having your NFT on the wine label! Oh and our NFT art will be really special. Because they’re designed by fine artist Ha Yael, you’re really buying collectible art on top of a collectible wine.

How was the idea for your company born? 

Vinsent has been building its NFT infrastructure for years; we’re applying all their existing work to the trend of NFT art collections with rarity attached. Vinsent, Tiffany, and I keep adding innovative new ideas (like fractional ownership with Seedling NFTs) and people are amazed at how fast we can execute.

What type of wine or grapes are you going to sell? 

As I mentioned, Vinsent sells wines for 100 wineries and owns its own vineyard. Why they’ve identified two fantastic grape harvests to bottle, it all depends on how many NFTs we sell. We’ll announce details once we’ve finalized sales, but it’ll be an award-caliber wine from a well-known winemaker. We want something very special for our first release. We can confirm though that it’ll be red wine!

Is there a place where people can sample your wine? 

Our wine will never be available outside of our NFT launch! The only way to try it will be to buy the NFT and burn it. This makes us extremely limited and collectible. In fact, the NFT art itself will be collectible. So in a sense, we’re building a collectible on top of a collectible!

Where can people purchase Hello Fam! wine?

Our launch is on August 31st, so we recommend following us on Twitter or on our Discord to stay up to date. On the day of, you’ll visit our website hellofam! wine with your MetaMask wallet and be able to mint. It’ll be available for 7 days or until it sells out, whichever happens first. All unminted cases will be burnt. 

Some NFTs sell out immediately, so that might happen with us too. After the initial sale, you can buy it on OpenSea and other NFT marketplaces.

What are the company’s plans for 2021 and into the next year?

Create a great NFT, great wine, and keep building the community. We want to launch collaborative wines with other NFT projects, tokenize other wineries, support artists, and donate a lot of money to charity along the way!

Hello Fam! is the first NFT winery for people to invest in. People tell us all the time that while they don’t understand NFTs in general, they love what we’re doing. They especially love that their best-case scenario is to grow with the NFT industry and their worst-case scenario is that they get delicious fine wine!" , catergoryByDate:"Lifestyle", date:"August 24, 2021")

Api::V1::WritersFeed.create(header: "Bitcoin surges over $50k as analyst makes ‘do or die’ price prediction
", blog_text:"Bitcoin has rocketed past $50,000 amid a rally in crypto prices that has also seen Ether spike above $4,000 and the value of altcoins ‘pop’. 

Analysts said the price rise could mark the beginning of a major price surge, or be the calm before a storm which will see the value of BTC suffer a serious slump. 

The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has been on an upward trajectory throughout the first few days of September, starting at about $47,000 and enjoying a bumpy ride upwards.

It surged over $50,000 Friday but has remained relatively steady at this level, hitting a high of $50,900 without managing to break the $51,000 barrier. 

It’s been a rough journey for Bitcoin in 2021, which started the year at less than $30,000, before surging up to $60,000 and then plunging down to January prices in July. 

The recent price rally has prompted one analyst to issue a mixed prediction which suggested that Bitcoin could soon face a boom if the price continues to rise – or a bust if its value starts to droop again. 

Ulrik K Lykke, Executive Director at digital asset hedge fund ARK36, said: “Breaking through the $50K range is going to be the do or die moment for Bitcoin and a gateway to new all-time highs. On the other hand, failing to push through this resistance will take the price down to the low $40K levels and might as well indicate a dead cat bounce.”

Luke added this: 

“At the same time, both the total digital asset market cap and altcoins market cap are testing ATHs. We’re seeing a wave of liquidity flowing through the altcoins market and creating the so-called popcorn effect where a number of different altcoins ‘pop’ or rapidly appreciate in price. As a result, Bitcoin has been losing market cap dominance to altcoins.”

Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that’s been enjoying good times in September. In fact, the total crypto market cap has been steadily rising since July, when it sank to a low of about $1.2 trillion before rising above $2 trillion towards the end of August. 

“It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin can reclaim these losses or whether altcoins will outperform Bitcoin and gain even more market cap dominance benefiting from a bigger network effect,” Lykke added.

Ruud Feltkamp, CEO at crypto trading bot CryptoHopper, claimed that breaking the $50,000 barrier could spark an even bigger rally.

He said: “Bitcoin is facing strong resistance around 50k. Once this is broken, we will probably see the price further going up to 59k, which is where it gets really exciting. Once that’s broken, we will probably enter the last part of this cycle.”

In September, Ether has also been performing well. Ethereum boosters often talk of the “flippening” in which Ether overtakes Bitcoin. 

While this doesn’t look likely to happen any time soon, the growth of the world’s second most valuable crypto has been impressive recently, climbing from a low of under $2,500 at the beginning of August to hover above and below $4,000 on September 3.

Martha Reyes-Hulme, Head of Research at digital asset prime brokerage and exchange Bequant attributed the uptick to the popularity of NFTS.

Holme said: “Is the flippening happening? The breakout in Ethereum continued overnight, to levels last seen in May of this year, and cascaded into Cardano, Ripple, and Polkadot.” 

She adds: 

“BTC wants to join the party, too, lagging a bit but crossing the 50k level several times this morning. Bitcoin dominance has been falling towards 40% and may gradually weaken as investors branch out to other areas of the market, focusing more on use cases than pure store of value.” 

“NFTs are the tinder that ignited this latest move, capturing the public imagination and leading to over $3bn in transaction volume on OpenSea, the e-Bay of NFTs, in August alone, and over 10 million users now on Metamask, the wallet that connects to Ethereum. This is causing a spike in ETH gas fees, despite the London hard fork which was meant to ameliorate them.

Concluding, Holme had this to say: 

“Technicals are favorable, with muted ETH perpetual funding rates, having been negative until recently, low implied volatility, and the inflation rate below 1% as the demand for NFTs have caused a high burn of ETH fees post-London fork. 150k ETH gas has been burned, with OpenSea representing 30% of that. The August job report will be published tomorrow, which may impact the overall markets in the short term, but otherwise, we are optimistic for the second half of the year.”

Api::V1::WritersFeed.create(header: "Charting Crypto’s Surge In Latin America", blog_text:"Since El Salvador’s announcement to make Bitcoin legal tender, politicians in Latin America have been actively showing support to this new economy, one that will make Latin America a hub for crypto innovation.

Earlier in May, Mercado Libre, the e-commerce giant of Latin America, with its main headquarters in Argentina, announced a purchase of 7.8 million worth of BTC. Mercado Libre has a market share of approximately 174 million users in Latin America alone and having Bitcoin in their balance sheet further amplifies their financial strategy in the near future. The conversation around crypto is growing in Latin America, with the likelihood of more happening into 2022. 

Below you will find a brief look at 5 lawmakers that are taking the lead and welcoming crypto conversations in Latin America. Through their voice, crypto adoption is inevitable.

Gilson Marques — Brazil

Marques is a part of the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil and has shown great support towards bitcoin due to his libertarian beliefs. On June 7th of this year, Marques posted his laser eyes profile picture, illustrating his support of bitcoin, with the hashtag “taxation is theft.” Marques is part of the Novo Party, a libertarian Brazilian party, with a strong neoliberal belief that government should lack intervention in the state. He is excited about the future of bitcoin because once countries start to recognize bitcoin as a legal tender, banks will be expected to adopt cryptocurrency and will not be able to shut it down. Bitcoin reflects his perfect idea of a free state and open market.

Carlos Relaja — Paraguay

One of the most spoken characters of the week as he proposes a new Bitcoin law in Paraguay. Relaja has shown interest in the regularization of Bitcoin and other crypto-assets with the purpose to make Paraguay a crypto hub. Last week, Relaja and Fernando Silva submitted a bill to congress to regulate crypto assets to establish rules of legal, financial, and fiscal security. His goal is to attract mining and investing opportunities using their low rates of hydroelectric energy and regulatory advantages.

While Relaja is a supporter of crypto assets, he is also a big believer of regulation and centralization, making statements that he is not interested in making Bitcoin a legal tender, but rather allowing regulators and banks to participate in their crypto economy.

Francisco Sanchez — Argentina

Sanchez posted a laser eyes picture stating “ I can’t believe it, but that’s how it is.” While he has not had much to say after that, Argentine lawmakers last week presented a bill allowing workers to be paid in cryptocurrency.  

Argentina has suffered one of the most severe recessions of the year, with annual inflation of over 50%. Due to the economic landscape of the country, Argentinians have been using cryptocurrency to conserve their purchasing power and acquire other sources of income. Due to government-subsidized electricity, mining has become an attractive activity, with growing numbers of people interested in large-scale mining in the country.  Using crypto for salaries will make things easier by strengthening the Argentinian economy and alleviating the current inflation.

Gabriel Silva — Panama

After El Salvador announced the introduction of the bill to make bitcoin a legal tender, Silva announced his support towards Bitcon by stating that Panama can not be left behind, as they have to support cryptocurrency if they want to become a hub of technology and entrepreneurship.

Silva’s enthusiastic support faces many barriers considering that he belongs to an independent non-majority party and it won’t be as easy as what took place in El Salvador. While Panama might resist his proposition, as more and more countries use Bitcoin, Panama won’t have any other alternative but to allow bitcoin as a legal tender.

Nayib Bukele — El Salvador

Nayib Bukele has been an early advocate of Bitcoin, tweeting about it in 2017, and being frowned upon by the Salvadorian government and banking institutions. Now as president, he has been able to take the lead in crypto innovation, making Bitcoin a legal tender of the country. He has made multiple statements about the importance of helping the unbanked and boosting El Salvador’s economy through financial innovation.

Bitcoin Beach was a huge wake-up, realizing the potential of a small but mighty nation. With little to lose and much to win, Bukele is inspiring leaders around the world to take a stand in crypto adoption. With Bitcoin to be adopted in September and Volcano mining on the way, Bukele will go down in history as a leader and visionary, matching his Twitter Bio as the “Republic of the Savior”.

While most people often look at Latin America as a helpless continent,  one that has fallen behind in technology and enterprise, crypto represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for innovation and generational change. El Salvador will be a key player in the debate of bitcoin in Latin America, as many countries will look for guidance in bitcoin adoption.

The remainder of this year is going to be exciting." , catergoryByDate:"Featured", date:"July 22, 2021")

Api::V1::WritersFeed.create(header: "Crypto Breaches Soar: A Deeper Look", blog_text:"A new research study from the cryptocurrency review, advice, and news firm Crypto Head reveals that crypto breaches and fraud increased 40.7% in 2020 from 2019, with 2021 set to break last year’s record in terms of the number of offenses. 

The study does a deep dive into the number of significant breaches and fraud involving crypto from 2011 to 2021 to determine how much they have increased, how much has been taken, the biggest thefts, and the most commonly targeted countries and currencies. 

Here is a brief snapshot of the findings: 

$19.2bn has been stolen via crypto breaches and fraud in the last 10 years.


On average the number of offenses grows 41% every year.

2017 saw hackers make the most money, with a theft high of $4.7 billion in total and $223.5 million on average.


Bitcoin is the most targeted currency accounting for 33.3% of breaches and fraud.

The United States is the most commonly targeted country with 17 breaches and fraud specifically tied to this country, followed by the United Kingdom (12), South Korea (9).


It wasn’t the most targeted entity that suffered the most, as Turkey lost the highest sum through the Thodex scam, which saw $2 billion stolen, followed by Japan ($1.2 billion stolen in total) and China ($1 billion stolen in total).

Though, the vast majority of cases can’t be tied to any one country as 91 breaches and fraud are ‘undefined’.

The most common type of attack is breaches of wallets and exchanges, with 126 in the last ten years, which is far more than offenses involving DeFi attacks and fraud (both 41).

The largest breach on record is Mt. Gox where $615 million has been stolen over the years, leading to the platform ultimately becoming insolvent in 2014.

However, it’s been cases of fraud that were the most lucrative for criminals, seeing perpetrators walk away with on average $365 million – over 14 times as much as breaches.
