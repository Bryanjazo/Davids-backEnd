Api::V1::Lifestyle.create(header: "Navigating The Back To School Dance", blog_text:"There’s nothing quite like that end of summer feeling when the evenings cool down and you can smell fall in the gentle breeze. The end of summer ushers in a bit of sadness because the carefree days of the season are coming to a close. But the promise of fall helps alleviate that melancholy. 

    And if they haven’t started already, kids will be heading back to school soon. Remember the fun of buying school supplies as a youngster? This time of the year can be exciting, but it also signals a return to routines. This can be a challenge for young ones and adults alike. 
    
    We can avoid the struggle of adjusting to a back-to-school routine by taking a few steps to prepare and you’ll enjoy this season even more. 
    
    Outfit Planning
    
    Rather than waiting until Monday morning to pick out your ensemble for the day, try planning it out the night before. It’s hard enough to get the kids to wake up on time, let alone carve out a few minutes to eat breakfast and get ready for your own day to begin. Plus, mornings generally feel rushed because you’re on a deadline to get out of the door and get the kids onto the school bus and then over to the office. Take five minutes the night before to set aside what you and your kiddos want to wear for the next day. You’ll seriously thank yourself in the morning!
    
    Meal Prep
    
    While you’re at it, take another 10 minutes in the evening to put together a decent lunch for your day. You may not feel like figuring out what to eat for tomorrow, but doing so will help you avoid the pitfalls of not having a lunch picked out. 
    
    Of course, your kiddos may be able to buy school lunch. But not every adult has an in-office cafeteria, meaning you either forgo lunch–not a great idea–or you have to rush over to a fast-food place to scarf down something vaguely resembling food. Planning lunch ahead of time can help you avoid eating bad food or starving all day long. 
    
    Go to Bed
    
    Watching just one more episode of your favorite series on Netflix late at night can be so tempting. Pretty soon, one episode leads to another and another and sure enough, it’s midnight and you finished the whole season. And it always sounds like a good idea at the time. Until your alarm goes off in the morning and you seriously regret your binge-watching idea. 
    
    Aim for seven or more hours of sleep if you can, then give yourself a bedtime, just like you do for your kids. While it might not feel very fun, your day will go so much better when you all get the right amount of shut-eye. 
    
    Choose Your Alarm Wisely
    
    Hitting the snooze button once your alarm clock starts blaring can be all too tempting. Except you can easily fall into the trap of repeatedly hitting snooze just to doze off for a few moments and be rudely awakened–again–by that darn alarm clock. 
    
    On the flip side, some people try to grab as much sleep as they possibly can and set an alarm that doesn’t even give them time to fully wake up, let alone eat breakfast or drop the kids off at the bus stop. 
    
    Go for a happy medium and set your alarm so you have enough time to get ready without a mad rush, yet not so much time that you feel free to hit snooze nine times in a row. 
    
    Blockchain Goes Academic
    
    In this back-to-school season, more and more useful technologies are cropping up. Blockchain is even getting used by some schools, interestingly enough. In addition to its uses in record-keeping, some educators are giving cryptocurrency to students as a way to incentivize them to do well. 
    
    A Better Back to School Season
    
    Employing some of these tips as you and your family get back into your fall routines can really help smooth things out. And who knows, you just might hear more about blockchain as we enter this back-to-school season.

    Api::V1::Lifestyle.create(header: "Bringing Fitness to the Blockchain of Wellness", blog_text:"After the year (or more!) we’ve all had, it’s not too surprising that a focus on wellness has popped into the trend spotlight. 

    Wellness can mean all sorts of things, from overall health to mental health to spiritual health to physical health and everything in between. It can often mean a more holistic focus on all of the above components since they’re all connected in one way or another.
    
    Regardless of what wellness means to you, there are some exciting things about wellness that are trending in a few areas. Let’s explore them and their potential impacts. 
    
    Fitness Tech and Blockchain
    
    A push for better physical fitness as a way to help ward off chronic disease has contributed to a rise in wearable technology. More than just the old-school pedometers that counted your daily steps, we now have access to a somewhat dizzying array of wristbands or smartphone apps that can help us track everything about our physical health, from how well we sleep to how many miles we jog in a week. You can even map out your daily jogging route and post it, along with a sweaty selfie of course, to Instagram after you’re done.
    
    While this technology is convenient, it can represent some potential privacy problems. It seems that hackers are in the news nearly every day, having hacked into some large tech company’s database. Perhaps you aren’t too concerned with someone seeing how many steps you took. But what if a hacker gained access to your daily jogging route and could track you wherever you went? 
    
    Fortunately, some enterprising organizations have developed a more private option using blockchain technology. Blockchain can help you track this type of data. It can also help keep physical fitness information more private, which is a good thing in this modern day and age. Some companies even offer fitness classes through their apps, providing new workouts to try along with enhanced privacy.
    
    Wellness Retreats
    
    If you’re not quite as into taking physical fitness classes or keeping track of your daily miles, perhaps wellness retreats are more your style. Travel + Leisure noted that wellness retreats seem to be gaining in popularity as of recent months. 
    
    As with the term ‘wellness’ itself, wellness retreats encompass a wide range of activities. You might enjoy a spa-focused resort that enhances relaxation, for instance. Or you might find a retreat that offers gentle yoga and meditation to calm the mind. Some retreats offer a combination of spa services and exercise-focused packages to keep your mind and body in good health. 
    
    Unique Spa Treatments
    
    Speaking of spas, there are some in the United States that offer rather unusual services with some interesting benefits. The Monarch Casino Resort & Spa in Colorado for instance offers up its Gemstone Signature Massage, complete with a full-body dry brushing for exfoliation prior to the massage itself. Their menu notes that they use an ‘exquisite gemstone oil’ during the massage along with the more traditional hot stones. Or go all out and get the massage along with a gemstone facial or gemstone body wrap to really pamper yourself. 
    
    These services don’t come cheap, but they certainly sound heavenly for someone in need of some relaxation! (And really, I personally find it hard to resist something that involves anything even remotely sparkly.)
    
    Wellness is Here to Stay
    
    In some ways, it feels a bit overdue that we’re all a little more focused on health and wellness. The trend of incorporating wellness into a getaway or a spa’s offerings is wonderful. And the blend of blockchain technology and wellness apps looks like it will be a beautiful combination, allowing both usefulness and privacy.

    Api::V1::Lifestyle.create(header: "Wine, Warm Weather, and a Block Party", blog_text:"Wine is not just for savoring in the fall and winter. In fact, wine is just as good in warm weather as it is on cool, crisp autumn evenings. The key is to switch up your wine game a bit so that you have the right body and flavor for summer weather. 

        And yes, it may be nearing the end of August, but that does not mean warm weather is on its way out. Depending on where you live, you might be lucky enough to get to enjoy milder temperatures all year long. Even if you’re in a region that experiences the change of seasons, you still have ample time to discover your new favorite type of wine for warmer days.
        
        White Wines
        
        If you’ve ever spent any time around wine at all, you have likely heard that white wine is the best wine for hot summer days. There are indeed many white wines that pair perfectly with a day drenched in gorgeous summer sunshine, and there are a few characteristics that you’ll want to look for in white wine.
        
        First, you’ll want to pick out a bottle of white that’s higher in acidity, a bit drier, and has a lighter feel to it. If this sounds like Greek to you, just remember that acidity in a summery wine is a good thing–it makes it more vibrant. 
        
        When you look for a dry wine, that means it’s generally not very sweet. Wines with a lighter body to them are generally a bit lower in alcohol content and even feel just a bit lighter on the tongue.
        
        Try a Riesling if you’re just venturing into white wines. You can pick out something on the dry side but many sweet options exist if that’s more your style. Sauvignon blanc is another wonderful way to add white wine to your late summer repertoire. 
        
        Red, Red Wine
        
        I personally still enjoy a good glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, even in the summertime. However, not everyone is a diehard Cab fan. That’s why there are red wines such as Pinot Noir, which is just a bit lighter and refreshing. 
        
        If you’re a fan of bubbly drinks, then you’ll want to get yourself a bottle of Lambrusco. It’s fun to say, and fun to drink! 
        
        And if you opt for red wine, remember to go for higher acidity, just like with white wine. Reds that get better when they’re served cool are also a win for warm evenings, as that makes them even more refreshing. 
        
        Rosé All Day
        
        No summer wine roundup is complete without mentioning rosé. It’s basically a pink-hued glass of perfection that lands somewhere in the middle of white wine and red wine. In other words, it’s the best of both worlds. 
        
        Try a Pinot Noir rosé if you’re someone who enjoys wines that aren’t quite so sweet.  If you prefer your wines on the sweet side, try a white Zinfandel. Yes, the name is misleading, but it really is a rosé.
        
        Watch out for Knockoffs
        
        If you’re considering a splurge on a warm-weather wine from an iconic vineyard, beware of the potential for low-quality wines to pose as high-ticket wines. Even in the winemaking world, knockoffs do exist. Up to 20 percent of wines that are sold as ‘premium’ might actually be fake, according to some experts.
        
        Fortunately, blockchain technology is once again coming to the rescue with some impressive ways to track the authenticity of that pricey bottle of vino. Companies like Entrust/Enseal are harnessing the power of blockchain to give their consumers the peace of mind to know that their investment bottle of wine is actually the real deal.
        
        End of Summer Sips
        
        No matter whether you go with white, red, or rosé wine, you’re sure to enjoy sipping on a new favorite wine as you soak up the last few days of the summer. Here’s hoping we get a beautifully warm autumn, the better to savor those lighter, beautifully acidic glasses of wine!

    Api::V1::Lifestyle.create(header: "The Exciting New Flight Path of Supersonic Planes", blog_text:"By Brittany VanDerVille

        If you think about it, travel can be an awesome leisure pursuit. We have certainly come a long way since the days of wagon trains and pioneers migrating out West in the days of Laura Ingalls Wilder. Back then, traveling just a few miles was a major undertaking and took a long time. 
        
        These days, we are fortunate enough to have cars that can eat up sixty miles of road in an hour (depending on whether or not you obey the speed limit, of course). We have trains that take us cross-country and motorcycles that let us see the world with the wind whipping all around us with nothing between you and nature. And of course, we have airplanes that can take us literally around the world. 
        
        Even as the travel industry remains on uncertain ground at the moment, it’s ever-evolving and even improving thanks to various technologies. In particular, the air travel industry could use a little more improvement in the comfort department, at least in my opinion. 
        
        Anyone who has taken a flight from the United States to anywhere overseas knows that eight or more hours in a teeny tiny airplane seat can get rather uncomfortable, to say the least. 
        
        The World of Supersonic Planes
        
        Yes, that’s right: a supersonic plane. Travel + Leisure (T+L) reported recently that United Airlines is working on a supersonic plane that could drastically cut back on the amount of time world travelers spend on a flight.
        
        United seems to be betting on this new and improved air transportation since they bought 15 of the ‘Overture’ airplanes from Boom, the manufacturer of these speedy planes. Their contract apparently also allows United Airlines to buy another 35 planes if they so choose. 
        
        Speed and Sustainability
        
        So how fast are these supersonic planes? We’ll put it this way: travelers who frequently fly from New York to London will be overjoyed to learn that flight times may only be less than four hours. For those who may not have flown this route before, a typical plane ride will last somewhere around seven hours. For busy travelers, those extra few hours could be quite useful. 
        
        You might hear ‘supersonic plane’ and understandably assume it will consume a lot more jet fuel than typical planes. However, you would be (happily) wrong in this case. Eco-minded travelers will love the fact that these planes are reported to be “net-zero carbon,” according to T+L. Plus, these planes will run on fully sustainable fuel.
        
        Unfortunately, the planes aren’t quite ready to take on passengers just yet. They’re expected to have their first flights in 2026. And it won’t be until around 2029 that they’ll take on passengers. 
        
        Improved Efficiency with Blockchain
        
        While we wait for these amazingly speedy planes, we can certainly appreciate other improvements to the travel industry. Blockchain for instance has the potential to help airlines improve their planes’ efficiency.
        
        Maintaining airplanes is a lot of work. And it involves a ton of data, from what work was done on it to who performed the work and how often maintenance checks were done. That can really add up and make things hard to track or hard to verify when needed. 
        
        Blockchain can add efficiency to this obstacle by providing a secure place to store all of this information and much more. That could add up to increased safety as well as improved efficiency.
        
        Improvements to Travel
        
        While supersonic planes aren’t here just yet, it is rather exciting to think that airlines can potentially halve the time it takes to fly to far-flung destinations. And as we eagerly await the arrival of the first supersonic flights for passengers, we can learn about other improvements to the airline industry such as increased plane efficiency and maintenance courtesy of blockchain technology. 
        
        Here’s to safer, speedier, and more sustainable air travel!

    Api::V1::Lifestyle.create(header: "How Old Do You Think You Are? — Part 2 of Adulthood Series", blog_text:"Diving into Part 2 of the Adulthood series, I will recap what it covers. And if you haven’t read Part 1, you can do so here before returning for the rest…

        What this series covers are recent discoveries about what it means to be a part of the “adult” club.  I cover three main topics, and I refer to them as pillars as they are essential to our growth and therefore have a large impact on our approach to life as an adult. 
        
        Like anything, if practiced and honed, they become a consistent way of behaving in relation to others. They also have the effect of developing us into more mature individuals with a clearer, healthier sense of self, building better relationships with others, and making life more rewarding. 
        
        All three address the importance of getting in touch with our own bodies, feelings, and belief systems. I’ve put a framework around it: a “me first” awareness, response, and reaction. 
        
        The hazard of not exercising these pillars promotes a state of confusion or fogginess as to our sense of self, purpose, and existence as a human. Let me explain: we must first begin with ourselves (our values, needs, mental wellbeing, etc.), before we can authentically give the same to others.  
        
        Imagine serving other’s needs despite your own.  This can only be sustained for so long before the structure of yourself starts to wear away and eventually crumble.  But imagine tuning into yourself first and operating from that place, then serve others accordingly.  Both you and the relationship with others will be built off a stronger, more authentic relationship structure, not a structure that has integrity issues and is already compromised. 
        
        All three pillars talk about being self-aware and in tune with our inner world in a very basic human way.  But, unfortunately, some of us have lost awareness of this basic human capability.  Perhaps it was never fully developed in the first place.
        
        For a quick recap, the first pillar talked about getting intimately in touch with feelings, from moment to moment.  This can be hard to do, because sometimes we block out certain feelings or our awareness of them.  Our busy minds get filled with defensive, accusatory or self-preserving thoughts that further activate our emotions, oftentimes in unproductive ways.  When this happens, it can be very difficult to process a situation rationally as our thoughts dominate and fuel our emotions, which can lead us to spin out of control.
        
        Let’s now dive into understanding how we are wired and where our wiring came from.
        
        Pillar #1: Let’s Talk Trauma and Triggers
        
        Throughout life, we are constantly in situations where we receive input and apply meaning to that input.  This, in turn, alters our beliefs and associated behaviors.  These new beliefs can become a set of guiding principles about ourselves and others.  They can inform how we interact with others and who we enjoy interacting with. 
        
        And, as new events occur that have a similar “appearance” to the original set of events, we label and apply the original beliefs and behave accordingly to it as we had in the past.  It’s the process of an emotional imprint and behavioral patterning. 
        
        What am I referring to? Triggers.
        
        Triggers are impulses – emotional hijacking – that can throw our calm existence into chaos.  When triggers appear and reappear, it’s our body’s way of communicating to us that we’ve been adversely and deeply affected by something in the past that still is affecting us today. 
        
        If we don’t understand their origin, what meanings we tie to them, and how they show up in a variety of situations, then we will likely be subject to a constant repeat of emotional hijacking and dysfunction in how we relate to others when we get triggered. 
        
        Their Origin
        
        So where do triggers come from?  Triggers are a result of some level of trauma.  Many things can create trauma.  Trauma can be a singular event or a series of events occurring over time.  Trauma is very personal to each individual.  What might be highly traumatic to one person, may not be as traumatic to another.
        
        Sometimes we don’t even realize that we’ve been subjected to trauma.  Sometimes we are a recipient of someone else’s dysfunctional or volatile behavior.  And sometimes in a family dynamic, we are neglected as a result of someone else’s need for attention.  
        
        Trauma can be a hurtful statement or even a non-response or a discouraging expression made by someone we look up to for support, validation, or approval (e.g., mother, father, or caregiver).  Sometimes trauma can result from a natural catastrophe or an accident we have been involved in or an observer of. 
        
        Trauma can be anything that affects us in an adverse way that causes an intense emotional response.  And trauma can also be subtle.  Subtle trauma can repeat over a series of years or many decades before we even understand the effect it has had on us.
        
        Their Meanings
        
        Once the traumatic event has occurred, we assign meanings to it – beliefs we create about ourselves or others.  These beliefs are oftentimes false.  They are not overarching truths to live by – but we often do, unfortunately.
        
        Those beliefs now show up in future situations and relationships.  As false beliefs, they become the underlying meaning that we assign to various interactions with other people. We get triggered by situations and people who call up or bring to the surface those overarching false truths we’ve assigned to ourselves and others.
        
        These interpretations and associated meanings and emotions suppress our ability to operate at a more productive level.  They can result in conflict with others and/or we may withdraw from others.  They can affect the degree of pleasure we have in relationships.  They can affect our capacity to trust.  They can impact our ability to manage our own emotions and behaviors.  They can alter our interest in things and people. 
        
        Trauma and triggers have the power to significantly alter the course and outcome of our lives.  But there is hope, as it starts with an awareness and understanding of them.
        
        How To Address Them
        
        Whatever trauma has been experienced, the body keeps the score. 
        
        An excellent book that I adamantly suggest anyone read is “The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma by Bessel van der Kolk.  Van der Kolk is one of the world’s foremost experts on trauma.  He explains how trauma reprograms our body, mind, and brain.  He explains how it affects the sufferers’ capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. 
        
        But, there is hope.  Van der Kolk provides ways of dealing with trauma, so we aren’t hijacked by these beliefs and emotions and instead are better able to reclaim our lives.
        
        History informs today and today is a reflection of yesterday.  So we make every effort to learn from history.  We actively work on stopping the emotional cycle that can often repeat itself.  We actively do the work to fully understand our triggers, their origin, and the meanings we apply to them.  And as we do this, we will experience a new, more productive way of relating to others.
        
        If we understand trauma and its potential negative impact, then perhaps we can minimize our exposure to it or remove ourselves from certain situations. 
        
        Because trauma happens without warning, our best action is to be aware of our body’s response to it and then address it as quickly as possible.  This might require counseling or actively addressing the person who created an uncomfortable or hurtful situation.
        
        The action of identifying and vocalizing our feelings towards an event, to the person causing it, and/or to a trusted and trained counselor, we begin the healing process.  Dealing with trauma and triggers can be a very arduous and painful undertaking. 
        
        This article is not intended to cover every aspect of trauma and triggers, nor to provide actionable steps to resolve them.  The main point here is to gain awareness of them and their impact on our lives. 
        
        Understanding trauma is not about pointing blame.  It’s about understanding that it has happened, how it has affected our belief systems (about ourselves and others), and how it shows up and affects our interactions and the decisions we make over our lifespan.  
        
        I’d like to end this pillar with the works of therapist Dr. Walter J. Broadbent Ph.D.  I introduced him in Part 1 and shared two points from his document titled “69 Characteristics of Successful Adulthood.”  Here are 5 more that fit nicely with our discussion of Pillar 2:
        
        1.  Adults seek out an understanding of their internal struggles.
        
        2. They are self-responsible.
        
        3. They don’t try to push their responsibilities off on others.
        
        4. They seek to continue to establish who they are.
        
        5. They want to grow personally even more than they already have. They strive to do this.

    Api::V1::Lifestyle.create(header: "The Global Water Shortage: Will It Alter Our Way Of Life?", blog_text:"Six years ago The Guardian published an article on the freshwater shortage and a looming global crisis. At the time of publication, residents of São Paulo, Brazil (once known as the City of Drizzle) were so desperate to find water that they were drilling through their own basement floors to access groundwater amid strict rationing policies. 

    The situation has not improved. 
    
    How Bad Is The Water Shortage?
    
    Lake Urmia in Iran is quickly becoming a salt plain. The lake’s demise was rapid, falling from “5,400 square kilometers (2,085 square miles) in the 1990s to just 2,500 square kilometers (965 square miles) today — according to the Department of Environmental Protection of West Azerbaijan.” 
    
    Like the water, the tourist revenue the lake generated has also disappeared. 
    
    Across the United States lakes are drying up, rivers are running low and freshwater sources are becoming more and more difficult to find as heatwaves wash over the country, setting new record high temperatures. 
    
    The Western half of the United States is categorized as being in a condition of severe drought. This has prompted the U.S. government to cut water allocations from the Central Valley Project to California by 75 percent, negatively impacting many farming communities and cities. In Oregon, there is not enough water to support both endangered fish and farmers. Water rationing is prompting outrage from farmers watching thirsty crops wither and die in the intense heat this summer has brought. 
    
    For the first time ever the federal government has declared a water shortage in the Colorado River basin. This means that states like New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada will have their water allocation cut in 2022.  The water level in Lake Mead (the largest U.S. reservoir) on the Arizona-Nevada border is expected to be too low to meet the needs of many of the Western communities that depend on it.
    
    “Like much of the West, and across our connected basins, the Colorado River is facing unprecedented and accelerating challenges,” Assistant U.S. Secretary for Water and Science Tanya Trujillo said in a statement.
    
    Colorado’s governor, Jared Polis, along with governors from nine other states affected by the prolonged drought conditions, have asked the Biden administration to declare a federal emergency. This would free up funds to help struggling ranchers and farmers from having to sell off livestock because of dwindling feed supplies along with skyrocketing hay costs. 
    
    The Federal Emergency Management agency rarely makes declarations of this kind for drought situations. Rather it’s typically for hurricane damage or flooding. However, water shortages can lead to food shortages and local economic devastation that eventually affect entire states. That makes it a federal emergency as there is a critical need for funding to help farmers, ranchers, and the communities they live in survive. 
    
    Drought And Hunger
    
    Worldwide, approximately  70 percent of fresh-water usage is for agricultural purposes. In the United States, that number is 80 percent.  Most of the water is moved through old, leaky, outdated irrigation canals, pipes, and other infrastructure, resulting in waste. 
    
    With the world’s population living longer, the demand for food increases each year, straining water supplies to grow and sustain crops to feed livestock and people. When farmers can no longer adequately irrigate their crops they are forced to sell off the land reducing the amount of food available. Once the land is sold it is usually developed for commercial or residential use and its ability to support to the food chain is lost forever. 
    
    The resulting food supply shortages will inevitably lead to mass starvation especially in regions of the world where a majority of the population is already undernourished. This is predicted to give rise to conflicts internally in many countries and eventually externally as the fight for a precious natural resource like water intensifies. 
    
    No Easy Answers
    
    To fight world hunger more and more land is needed to grow crops with an equal amount of demand for freshwater to sustain them. Expanding agriculture also means draining more of the planet’s freshwater supplies away from some areas to support others, for example, from cities to rural farming communities. 
    
    To address climate change there has been a push to develop biofuels. While better for the environment by reducing greenhouse emissions, these crops demand a lot of water. 
    
    “In India, increased biofuel production to meet 10% of its transportation fuel demand by 2030 will require an estimated 22 cubic kilometers more irrigation water, about 5% of what is currently used in Indian food production, pushing the country further into water scarcity. India can ill afford these additional water resources.”  Issues.org
    
    In the U.S., some states have offered farmers and ranchers money to leave water in the rivers and lakes so it can be diverted to thirsty cities. However, this means tough choices for those whose livelihood depends on water for crops and/or livestock to sell. If farmers plant less, that leads to food shortages, especially feed for livestock. Once livestock is sold off and slaughtered generations of animals are lost. For many forgoing their water means losing their family farm or ranch and the money is not worth it. 
    
    What Can Be Done To Conserve Water?
    
    There is no doubt, water shortages are in the not too distant future and people will have to adapt. Innovation, creativity, and global initiatives will be necessary to ward off the worst of the water shortage crisis coming our way.
    
    Technology
    
    Technological advancements could be the key to manage and monitor the world’s freshwater supplies more efficiently, thereby reducing waste. The Western Nebraska Irrigation Project launched in 2004 was a collaboration between The Nature Conservancy, The World Wildlife Fund, John Deere, and Coca-Cola to help farmers better monitor their water use to aid in conservation. Over a three-year period, the ranchers involved ultimately cut water consumption from aquifers by 20 percent. The technology used included soil moisture probes, pivot telemetry (water data collection), and weather stations for better forecast information. 
    
    “Less groundwater pumping not only helps secure the resiliency of the underlying aquifer, it also saves the farmers time and money.” One participating farmer reported “the probes paid for themselves easily each year,” while another noted the technology saved time because he didn’t have to drive to his field to check conditions.”
    
    Blockchain
    
    A company called WaterChain.io is using blockchain technology to create a decentralized method to “fund the next generation of water treatment projects around the world with a dedicated organization, or project management company, to select and manage the treatment facility projects.” 
    
    The idea is to use cryptocurrencies to fund water treatment facilities to better recycle water and token holders share in the profits.
    
    This innovative use of digital currency to help increase the amount of water released to be recycled instead would help communities across the globe have access to clean fresh water for drinking and irrigation by eliminating waste. 
    
    Financial Incentives
    
    When the U.S. Fish and Game Service in San Antonio, Texas lost a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club to end the overconsumption of water from the Edwards Aquifer that was endangering several species of fish, the city quickly found ways to cut back on its water use. 
    
    Using regulation and incentives San Antonio reduced water consumption from 225 gallons per person per day to only 140 gallons. Their methods included:
    
    Replacing  older high-flow toilets and urinals with more water efficient models.
    Rebates  for water-saving efforts with improved irrigation systems 
    Encouraging residents to replace lawns with native, drought-tolerant plants and patios in their landscaping
    Smarter lawn watering tips during the hot summer months
    In Nevada, residents were offered cash incentives to replace their lawns with desert landscaping. 
    
    How The Water Shortages Will Change How We Live
    
    If drastic measures are not taken right away many of the things we take for granted and enjoy could be lost to future generations. Even in our own lifetimes, we could see the dramatic negative consequences of careless water management. 
    
    A nation like the United States that wastes millions of pounds of food a year could find itself with food shortages.
    
    Communities could face water rationing with meters installed on their homes to cut off water flow once the allotted amount has been used. 
    
    Lush green yards will have to be replaced with concrete and rock beds.
    
    Natural grass sports fields will be a thing of the past.
    
    Recreational organizations like public swimming pools, golf courses, and parks could be dramatically reduced meaning only the wealthiest will have access to these kinds of “luxuries.”
    
    What Everyone Can Do To Conserve Water
    
    The water shortage crisis can be avoided. It will take a global effort but locally everyone can do their part to reduce personal water use. Communities and states can vote for legislators who will work to adopt policies and write laws to better manage the nation’s water resources and support innovation and technology to conserve the planet’s most precious resource.

Api::V1::Blockchain.create(header: "Bitcoin surges over $50k as analyst makes ‘do or die’ price prediction", blog_text:"Bitcoin has rocketed past $50,000 amid a rally in crypto prices that has also seen Ether spike above $4,000 and the value of altcoins ‘pop’. 

    Analysts said the price rise could mark the beginning of a major price surge, or be the calm before a storm which will see the value of BTC suffer a serious slump. 
    
    The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has been on an upward trajectory throughout the first few days of September, starting at about $47,000 and enjoying a bumpy ride upwards.
    
    It surged over $50,000 Friday but has remained relatively steady at this level, hitting a high of $50,900 without managing to break the $51,000 barrier. 
    
    It’s been a rough journey for Bitcoin in 2021, which started the year at less than $30,000, before surging up to $60,000 and then plunging down to January prices in July. 
    
    The recent price rally has prompted one analyst to issue a mixed prediction which suggested that Bitcoin could soon face a boom if the price continues to rise – or a bust if its value starts to droop again. 
    
    Ulrik K Lykke, Executive Director at digital asset hedge fund ARK36, said: “Breaking through the $50K range is going to be the do or die moment for Bitcoin and a gateway to new all-time highs. On the other hand, failing to push through this resistance will take the price down to the low $40K levels and might as well indicate a dead cat bounce.”
    
    Luke added this: 
    
    “At the same time, both the total digital asset market cap and altcoins market cap are testing ATHs. We’re seeing a wave of liquidity flowing through the altcoins market and creating the so-called popcorn effect where a number of different altcoins ‘pop’ or rapidly appreciate in price. As a result, Bitcoin has been losing market cap dominance to altcoins.”
    
    Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that’s been enjoying good times in September. In fact, the total crypto market cap has been steadily rising since July, when it sank to a low of about $1.2 trillion before rising above $2 trillion towards the end of August. 
    
    “It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin can reclaim these losses or whether altcoins will outperform Bitcoin and gain even more market cap dominance benefiting from a bigger network effect,” Lykke added.
    
    Ruud Feltkamp, CEO at crypto trading bot CryptoHopper, claimed that breaking the $50,000 barrier could spark an even bigger rally.
    
    He said: “Bitcoin is facing strong resistance around 50k. Once this is broken, we will probably see the price further going up to 59k, which is where it gets really exciting. Once that’s broken, we will probably enter the last part of this cycle.”
    
    In September, Ether has also been performing well. Ethereum boosters often talk of the “flippening” in which Ether overtakes Bitcoin. 
    
    While this doesn’t look likely to happen any time soon, the growth of the world’s second most valuable crypto has been impressive recently, climbing from a low of under $2,500 at the beginning of August to hover above and below $4,000 on September 3.
    
    Martha Reyes-Hulme, Head of Research at digital asset prime brokerage and exchange Bequant attributed the uptick to the popularity of NFTS.
    
    Holme said: “Is the flippening happening? The breakout in Ethereum continued overnight, to levels last seen in May of this year, and cascaded into Cardano, Ripple, and Polkadot.” 
    
    She adds: 
    
    “BTC wants to join the party, too, lagging a bit but crossing the 50k level several times this morning. Bitcoin dominance has been falling towards 40% and may gradually weaken as investors branch out to other areas of the market, focusing more on use cases than pure store of value.” 
    
    “NFTs are the tinder that ignited this latest move, capturing the public imagination and leading to over $3bn in transaction volume on OpenSea, the e-Bay of NFTs, in August alone, and over 10 million users now on Metamask, the wallet that connects to Ethereum. This is causing a spike in ETH gas fees, despite the London hard fork which was meant to ameliorate them.
    
    Concluding, Holme had this to say: 
    
    “Technicals are favorable, with muted ETH perpetual funding rates, having been negative until recently, low implied volatility, and the inflation rate below 1% as the demand for NFTs have caused a high burn of ETH fees post-London fork. 150k ETH gas has been burned, with OpenSea representing 30% of that. The August job report will be published tomorrow, which may impact the overall markets in the short term, but otherwise, we are optimistic for the second half of the year.”

    Api::V1::Blockchain.create(header: "Why The U.S. Lags Behind Other Countries In Adopting Cryptocurrencies.", blog_text:"There is no denying that interest in cryptocurrencies is continuing to grow in America. Despite the fact that the U.S. lags behind many other countries that have a significantly larger percentage of their population invested in digital coins.

    Why is that? 
    
    Americans Are All About Crypto
    
    Americans are all about crypto, at least when it comes to search engines. Last year there were approximately 2.5 million online searches regarding bitcoin. With billionaires like Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, and many A-list celebrities and professional sports figures touting it as the future of finance, interest in learning about and investing in cryptocurrencies has surged over the last two years. Even a roller coaster ride of market volatility has not deterred Americans from continuing to explore and invest in digital currencies. 
    
     A report from Portfolio Insider estimates approximately 46 million Americans have purchased a digital currency of some kind, approximately 17 percent of the adult population. Surprisingly, that only lands us at number 26 on a list of 27 countries with the highest percentage of the population invested in some kind of digital currency according to this report by Finder.com. 
    
    Countries With The Largest Number of Crypto Owners
    
    So what countries are at the top of that list? 
    
    It may surprise you (or not) to know that the top five countries with the most people invested in digital currencies are all in Asia. Vietnam landed at number one on the list with 41 percent of the adult population reporting some kind of digital coin investment. Indonesia, India, Malaysia, and the Philippines are next. The top European country with the most citizens reporting investment in digital currency is Belgium at number six followed by Italy at number 10. 
    
    Tiny countries like Austria, New Zealand, and Ireland all rank higher than the United States in terms of the biggest percentage of the population invested in cryptocurrencies. 
    
    Analysts believe that countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, and now Afghanistan have seen surges in crypto purchases because there is mistrust in their government’s management of financial markets or they don’t have access to a centralized exchange. Also, many residents of these countries “turn to cryptocurrency to preserve their savings in the face of currency devaluation, as well as to send and receive remittances and carry out business transactions.” CNBC.com
    
    Will the U.S. Catch Up?
    
    Despite lagging behind many other countries in adopting cryptocurrencies, the United States still leads the way in decentralized finance (DeFi) adoption, keeping the doors wide open for investments in cryptocurrencies to surge in the next few months and in 2022. 
    
    The two main causes of lesser crypto investments in this country are education, delays by lawmakers to approve several cryptocurrencies, and attempts to heavily regulate the industry.  
    
    It is clear Americans are eager to invest in the crypto space but a lack of education about how digital currencies work is holding many of them back.  A survey by MasterCard of 15,000 people from 18 different countries (including the U.S., of course) revealed that millennials (people ages 23 to 40[ish]) are the most active crypto researchers and investors. That tracks with the average age of U.S. citizens most likely to research and buy digital coins. In the survey, most people said a lack of understanding of how cryptocurrencies work is what gives them pause about buying any. 
    
    New tax reporting legislation written into the recently passed massive infrastructure bill is widely viewed as stifling the crypto market and SEC Chairman Hester Peirce has cautioned lawmakers about attempting to overregulate the industry.
    
    “The disproportionate focus on illicit uses and the underestimation of the protective uses of crypto is one example of how evidence-based rulemaking is not yet the norm in crypto-regulation. We can do better, and I hope that this year will mark a turning point for the United States, which in turn may spur other countries similarly to take a more sensible approach to crypto regulation.” Hester Peirce
    
    Lack of education and legislative attempts to increase regulation of the crypto industry have been holding back the United States from leading the world in cryptocurrency ownership, but that is not predicted to last.  With Bitcoin recently reaching an all-time high, investors and institutions pouring billions into the asset class, and more and more companies accepting digital coins as payment for their goods and services, 2022 is predicted to be a turning point for mainstream adoption.  
    
    America Can Lead In Cryptocurrency Adoption
    
    Investors and analysts agree, cryptocurrencies are not a fad and are here to stay. The United States is poised to lead the world in digital coin adoption despite lagging behind other countries with more citizens already invested. America has the most crypto ATMs, and the non-profit Digital Dollar Project has launched five pilot programs to test the potential uses of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). 
    
    A CBDC is basically a digital banknote and gives holders a direct digital claim on the central bank,  allowing them to make instant electronic payments. China and much of Europe have already invested in CBDCs and are racing to “fend off threats from cryptocurrencies and improve payment systems,” according to a report from Reuters.com
    
    Widespread access to digital dollars will help streamline payment processes and increase financial inclusion for millions of Americans hindered by traditional financial institutions’ transaction fees. 
    
    With our technological savvy, innovation, and the eagerness of tens of millions of Americans to learn about and invest in cryptocurrencies it is foreseeable the U.S. will lead the world in digital currency adoption. It is a matter of more widespread education programs about how cryptocurrencies work and pressure on legislators to back off crippling regulations in the industry.

    Api::V1::Blockchain.create(header: "BEXT360’s Ambitious Journey To Bring Blockchain to Developing Countries", blog_text:"Emerging technologies are creating opportunities for greater equity within developing countries that produce the very commodities we consume and utilize on a daily basis. 

    Whether it be coffee, cotton, cocoa, minerals, or palm oil, a digitized supply chain utilizing blockchain and other emerging technologies is improving access, accountability, transparency, traceability, pricing, product quality, and speed of delivery. 
    
    This optimization serves every stakeholder at each step within a supply chain network.  The outcome translates into improved livelihoods of production communities, greater peace of mind for wholesalers and retailers, and a more satisfying experience for end-use consumers.
    
    So, Who’s Reconfiguring Supply Chain Solutions?
    
    A young Denver-based software technology company, Bext Holdings Inc., has developed a complete digitized logistics system, or bext360 that can serve an entire product supply chain ecosystem from origin to end-user.  
    
     Using the SaaS platform, bext360 allows companies to track the origin, authenticity, and sustainability of their products. 
    
    With the use of Blockchain, AI, and mobile app technologies, their software is embedded into existing ERP and POS systems to provide end-to-end traceability for wholesalers and retailers. Data is collected at every stage of the supply chain, sustainable measures are qualified, and all of this becomes an immutable record on the Blockchain. 
    
    The benefit of Real-Time Transactions
    
    Traditionally, small farmers in developing countries are subject to middlemen who determine the quality and price of the crop and control how and when the farmers get paid.  Instead, bext360 has created an alternative means for adhering to a consistent process of assessing quality, generating a fair price, and paying farmers instantaneously once the crops have changed hands. 
    
    This is how it works: at the place of origin, bext360 utilizes a high-tech device or kiosk with the capabilities of analyzing crops, such as coffee cherries, by putting them through an imaging system that can determine the size and consistency of a cherry yield.  Using AI technology, the device captures a 360-degree image of the crops to assign an industry standard of quality and weight of the product being sold through Bluetooth IoT connection. 
    
    Bext360’s software utilizes Stellar, a global payment solution employing blockchain technology.  Through bext360 mobile app, the buyer and seller can facilitate the transaction by recording product quantity while processing instant payments to farmers based on price and weight.  All this data is inputted into traceable software.  The farmer can then be paid instantaneously in real-time at the point of selling the products.  For the retailer receiving shipments, a QR code is used to trace their products as they move end-to-end through the supply chain.
    
    How Did This Start-Up Start?
    
    From the U.S. and China to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and India, entrepreneur, founder and CEO Daniel Jones spent over 17 years living and working in emerging and frontier markets. 
    
    With deep knowledge in technology, applied mathematics, and e-commerce, Jones envisioned a network of digital solutions to solve the access needs in developing economies and improve the traceability, accountability, and sustainability of goods throughout the supply chain.
    
    SKS Venture Partners, an investment company that focused mostly on financial tech companies, invested $1.2 million of seed funding monies to support the launch and future developments of bext360.  In 2017, bext360 become the first company to trace coffee from origin to retailer using Blockchain.
    
    Blockchain Brings Hope to New Ways of Doing Business Worldwide
    
    According to the Fairtrade Foundation, “coffee is one of the world’s most popular beverages.  Around 125 million people worldwide depend on coffee for their livelihoods and 80% of it is produced by 25 million smallholders.”  However, many of these small-scale farmers are unable to earn equitable and reliable wages from the coffee beans they grow, harvest, and produce.
    
    Emerging technologies like Blockchain remain promising. In terms of breaking through issues of fraud, exploitation, and sustainability by digitizing and streamlining the supply chain process.

    Api::V1::Blockchain.create(header: "Crypto Breaches Soar: A Deeper Look", blog_text:"A new research study from the cryptocurrency review, advice, and news firm Crypto Head reveals that crypto breaches and fraud increased 40.7% in 2020 from 2019, with 2021 set to break last year’s record in terms of the number of offenses. 

    The study does a deep dive into the number of significant breaches and fraud involving crypto from 2011 to 2021 to determine how much they have increased, how much has been taken, the biggest thefts, and the most commonly targeted countries and currencies. 
    
    Here is a brief snapshot of the findings: 
    
    $19.2bn has been stolen via crypto breaches and fraud in the last 10 years.
    
    
    On average the number of offenses grows 41% every year.
    
    2017 saw hackers make the most money, with a theft high of $4.7 billion in total and $223.5 million on average.
    
    
    Bitcoin is the most targeted currency accounting for 33.3% of breaches and fraud.
    
    The United States is the most commonly targeted country with 17 breaches and fraud specifically tied to this country, followed by the United Kingdom (12), South Korea (9).
    
    
    It wasn’t the most targeted entity that suffered the most, as Turkey lost the highest sum through the Thodex scam, which saw $2 billion stolen, followed by Japan ($1.2 billion stolen in total) and China ($1 billion stolen in total).
    
    Though, the vast majority of cases can’t be tied to any one country as 91 breaches and fraud are ‘undefined’.
    
    The most common type of attack is breaches of wallets and exchanges, with 126 in the last ten years, which is far more than offenses involving DeFi attacks and fraud (both 41).
    
    The largest breach on record is Mt. Gox where $615 million has been stolen over the years, leading to the platform ultimately becoming insolvent in 2014.
    
    However, it’s been cases of fraud that were the most lucrative for criminals, seeing perpetrators walk away with on average $365 million – over 14 times as much as breaches.

    Api::V1::Blockchain.create(header: "Bitcoin surges over $50k as analyst makes ‘do or die’ price prediction", blog_text:"Recently, the Poly Network had to face the biggest network hack in DeFi history. A hacker known as MrWhiteHat stole people’s funds across blockchains.

    After being the victim of a $610 million hack, Poly Network took matters into its own hands by announcing a bug bounty program with Immunefi. 
    
    What Happened to Poly Network?
    
    Poly Network is a platform that allows interoperability between multiple blockchains. In this way, different blockchains can work together and change the way cryptocurrencies work. 
    
    In other words, this platform helped users transfer or exchange tokens across different blockchains. 
    
    And then, the hack happened. 
    
    One ordinary day, a hacker attacked the Poly network managing to steal 611M – arguably the biggest hack on DeFi so far. Poly Network immediately issued a statement to its community, addressed the hacker, and advocated for a peaceful resolution. 
    
    The hacker returned $10,000, which was later followed by $1M. Beyond some $33M that had been frozen by Tether, MrWhiteHat returned the rest of the funds by the end of the following day.
    
    Yet, what is still unclear is why the hacker carried out the theft. 
    
    It still is unknown whether it was to alert the platform of the flaw in its security system or whether it was to launder money? Well, according to the hacker, he just wanted to have fun… although this caused a tsunami of collective terror.
    
    Certainly, this situation proved to be a wake-up call for most platforms in terms of reviewing their security systems. It also tested how quickly each of these platforms would react to such an attack.
    
    The Aftermath Of The Hack: Damage Control
    
    Many people are still wondering what made this heist possible. Well, it is generally agreed in the tech security world that the hacker found a small bug that could bring down the entire security system of the platform. 
    
    This bug was responsible for the system vulnerability that made this heist possible. It’s a theft that became part of DeFi’s history and will always be remembered. 
    
    Yet, the Poly Network is attempting to leverage the situation by announcing its “Roadmap for Recovery“. The plan lays out how the network will be able to restore operations and fully recover user assets. The network also offered an apology to the community along with a roadmap for what’s ahead.
    
    The Poly Bounty Hack
    
    But these are not the only announcements made by the platform. They also are promoting a highly publicized $500,000 bug bounty program. 
    
    This works out perfectly as anyone who cares about DeFi security can take part. 
    
    Security is now more important than ever for the Poly Network as well as the safe return of assets to its users. 
    
    All these announcements show concern for the security of their users. They are working vigorously to maintain people’s trust in the DeFi circle.
    
    Immunefi – a renowned bug bounty platform – is part of the bug bounty. The initiative began on August 17. Prizes include $100,000 for each valid bug, with a total reward pool of $500,000. 
    
    In short, DeFi’s popularity needs more security to continue growing. Poly Network is now at the center of attention with respect to this narrative. As a result, it is re-evaluating its performance before and after the hack, making changes to ensure a secure future. Each of Poly Network’s announcements marks a before and after for the platform. 
    
    Poly Network handled the situation to the best of its ability. Their responses were quick and their action plans show that they want to keep their users safe and that they care about them. Yet, it is hard not to see what happened to them as a kind of cautionary tale. Let’s hope Poly can continue to bounce back and recover.
